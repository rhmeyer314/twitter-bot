# twitter-bot

The current state of this bot is very simple. It gives a status update including the current date, how many days are left 
in the year and the percentage of the year we have completed

Future updates are planned, such as favoriting and retweeting tweets from specific users, responding to tweets directed 
towards the bot, direct messaging, among other ideas.

At the moment the code is being run on an online python compiler, https://repl.it/languages/python3
